1. A regular Latin verb has four principal parts.
2. The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. They are in the first person, singular form.
3. faciō, facere, fēcī, factus; interficio, interficere, interfēcī, interfectum -- The third part is identical to prefixing -inter to a form a facio. The first part changes the a to an i in facio, the second part changes the a to an i in facere, and the fourth part changes the ending from -us to -um.
4. Audīo and venīo belong to the fourth conjugation. Their first and second principal parts are regular. Audīo's third principal part ends with -vī rather than just -ī, and its fourth principal part ends with -tus rather than just -us. Venīo's third principal part is regular but its fourth part is not: it ends with -tus rather than -us.
5. Both capīo and faciō change the "a" in their third part to "ē". They also both change the ending of their fourth principal part to -tus.
