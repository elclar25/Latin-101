B Translation:

When the Greeks had been in Troy for 10 years,  Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size. In it gathered Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus. And on the horse they wrote "THE GREEKS GIVE A GIFT TO MINERVA" and they carried it over to Tenedos. When the Trojans saw this, Priam led the horse into the temple of Minerva. When Cassandra said that the horse held enemies, belief was not given to her and they put the horse in front of the temple. The Greeks exited, killed the guards, and took Troy.
