Long ago, Prometheus, first son of Iapetus, fashioned humans from mud. At the same time, Vulcan fashioned a woman from mud. Minerva gave this woman a spirit and all the gods sent her a gift. For this reason, the name "Pandora" was given to her. Pandora was given to Epimetheo in marriage by Jove. Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
